==============

Platform based game with basic graphics written in the Turing programming language.

My first major project, created in 2011 with Jared Nathanson.

Jared created the cutscenes and helped with level design.

Tristan wrote the majority of code for the project, including the movement commands, interactions with the level, and changing levels.

Known Bug:
On the final boss fight, the player spawns slightly below the ground and dies.  Moving slightly to the left will reset the level and play will resume normally.
